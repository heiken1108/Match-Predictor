    "Predicting the outcome of a football match is a core problem within the sports betting industry. The goal of a betting company is to produce odds that accurately reflect the probable outcome of the match, in order to maintain a healthy profit margin. Predicting an outcome of a sports match is an inheently unceraint task, as the outcome is highly dependent on indivdual coincidences and random events. As a result, it is more relevant to predict the probability of a certain outcome, rather than the outcome itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting odds for a home win, draw and a away win is a difficult task. However, we want to approach the problem from this angle. To implement a predictor and evaluate it, we will aim to create a model which can assign a probibility of Home Victory, Draw and Away victory, and use this percentage to make a choice of whether it would bet on an outcome, or maybe not bet at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the probability of each outcome is 33%, by a random pick. Our goal is to create a model that can predict the outcome of a match with a higher accuracy than this. To do this we will use historic data about previous matches."
